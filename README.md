## How the Minimax Algorithm Works
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is commonly used in game theory. In this game, the algorithm is used to determine the best move for the computer player.
The algorithm works by recursively analyzing all possible moves and their outcomes. It assigns a score to each move based on the outcome of the game if that move is made. The computer player then chooses the move with the highest score, assuming the human player will also make the best possible move.
